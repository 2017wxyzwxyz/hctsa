{"name":"hctsa","tagline":"Highly comparative time-series analysis","body":"### hctsa\r\n\r\n*hctsa* is a comprehensive package of thousands of time-series analysis methods. The software allows the user to convert a time series into a vector of thousands of informative features, corresponding to different outputs of time-series analysis operations.\r\nConverting from a time series to a feature vector is useful for many tasks, such as:\r\n* *classification*: determining the most useful feature for distinguishing labeled groups of time series, e.g., diagnosing pathological time series\r\n* *regression*: determining a useful estimator of some continuous quantity assigned to a time series, e.g., predicting a patient's age from a recording of their speech\r\n\r\n### Time-series analysis features\r\nThe types of features included are diverse, and range from:\r\n* Linear correlation (autocorrelation, spectral density)\r\n* Information theoretic quantities (Approximate/Sample/Permutation entropy, auto mutual information)\r\n* Model fits (AR, ARMA, GARCH, Gaussian process regression, exponential smoothing, state space, HMM)\r\n* Nonlinear time-series analysis (fractal dimension estimates)\r\n* Scaling (detrended fluctuation analysis)\r\n* Stationarity (sliding window measures, StatAv)\r\n* Properties of the distribution (skewness, symmetry, distribution type)\r\n* Basis functions (wavelets)\r\n* Other measures (extreme events, visibility graphs, delay vector variance)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
