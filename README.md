Highly comparative time-series analysis code repository
This repository draws on the work published as:
B. D. Fulcher, M. A. Little, N. S. Jones (2013) Highly comparative time-series analysis: the empirical structure of time series and their methods. J. R. Soc. Interface. 10, 83.
As part of this work, hundreds of pieces of time-series analysis code were developed that produce thousands of features summarizing structural properties of time series.
This code repository helps the user set up a mySQL database through Matlab and perform highly comparative time-series analysis on custom datasets.
